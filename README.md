Designed and developed an online coffee shop application that allows users to browse, order, and manage coffee purchases seamlessly. The app features a user-friendly interface created with XML, robust functionality implemented in Kotlin, and a secure backend powered by Firebase. Key features include user authentication, real-time order management, and database integration for storing product details and user preferences. This project demonstrates my skills in mobile app development, UI design, backend integration, and leveraging modern tools for scalable and responsive applications.
